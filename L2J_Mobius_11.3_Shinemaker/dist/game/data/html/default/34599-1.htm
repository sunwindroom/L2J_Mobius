<html><body>Dethrone Guide Epitani:<br>
But I guess I am a Dethrone Guide, so I should tell you that much.<br>
<font color="LEVEL"> &lt;Deril's Water Source, Fran Deril's Water Source></font><br1>
It's in front of Dethrone Village, so there's no teleport available. Deril's Water Source is to the left, and Fran Deril's Water Source is to the right. They may look cute, but don't underestimate them. The monsters in Deril's Water Source are level 112, and the monsters of Fran Deril's Water Source are level 116. PvP is prohibited in Deril's Water Source.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">&lt;Area 1: Asha/Area 2: Anima/Area 3: Nox></font><br1>
The Asha, Anima, and Nox areas are filled with monsters of level 116, 120, and 124, respectively. If you are coming from the occupying server, you can use the teleport device to get to those areas. But if you are not from that server, you have to go there on your own.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">&lt;Calida Hall></font><br1>
Calida Hall is at the center of Dethrone. All monsters from Asha, Anima, and Nox are in this area. The monsters here are all level 124. Since the monsters from all areas are there, skilled adventurers will engage in fierce battle.<br>
<font color="LEVEL">&lt;Eigis's Abode></font><br1>
The Demonic Sword Eigis appears here. Do I need to say more? Hehe.<br>
