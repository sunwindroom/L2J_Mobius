The volunteers have finally come! There are many Embryo soldiers around who guard the Stronghold of the Messiah Castle. Your task is simple: destroy <font color="LEVEL">the Embryo Castle Siege Tank or the Embryo Castle Magic Cannon</font> of the Stronghold. After you destroy the mechanism or the cannon, one of the Embryo Commanders will appear.<br>
 By the way! Embryo's soldiers hid a Sayune nearby, which is used to transfer reinforcements. If you kill the Embryo Commander the hidden Sayune will appear. With this Sayune, you can move on. Well, good luck.
