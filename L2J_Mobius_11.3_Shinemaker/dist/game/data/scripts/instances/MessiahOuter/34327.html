I have been waiting for you, Heroes. Leona Blackbird and the advance parties have built strongholds and are waiting for your aid.<br>
Go to <font color="LEVEL">Sayunes</font> and select one of the squads, <font color="LEVEL">Leona Squad</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Sporcha Squad</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Elikia Squad</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Devianne Squad</font>.<br>
It was reported to me that <font color="LEVEL">Sayunes</font> is well hidden inside the castle. If you destroy <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Castle Siege Tanks</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Castle Magic Tanks</font>, one of the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Commanders</font> will appear. If you defeat the <font color="LEVEL">Embryo Commander</font>, Sayunes will show up, and you'll be able to move to the next area through it.
