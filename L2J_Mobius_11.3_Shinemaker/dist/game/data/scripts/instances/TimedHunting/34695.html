<html><body>Ivory Tower Researcher:<br>
We were studying the power source of Nephilims and Lilims when something went wrong. Suddenly a Time Rift appeared, and it created a dimension where past, present and future are mixed. Because of it, Nephilims and Lilims who are supposed to be dead long ago started to invade Catacombs and Necropolis. If we do nothing, the Time Rift will become larger, so more Nephilims and Lilims will come to our world. I'm sure you can imagine what's going to happen next. Please, help us!<br>
