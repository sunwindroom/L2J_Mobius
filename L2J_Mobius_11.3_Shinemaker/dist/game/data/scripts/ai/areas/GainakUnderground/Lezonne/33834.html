Are you a mercenary too?<br>
We've had a lot of them lately. Probably to ward off the Mysterious Assassins who occasionally invade and turn this place into a <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font>.<br>
And then it becomes peaceful again. But we don't know when it becomes a <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font> or how long the <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font> remains, so it's frustrating.<br>
I wonder what's going on...<br>
We don't know when it will turn into a <font color=LEVEL>battlefield</font>, so I can give you a buff just in case... I can't give it to you for free... It will be <font color=LEVEL>200000 Adena</font>.<br>
