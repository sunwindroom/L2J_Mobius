<html><body>Archaeologist Deton:<br>
My name is Deton. I'm a traveling archaeologist. I'm always glad to give a helping hand to other travelers.<br>
Archaeology allows to learn new secret knowledge of ancient times. Thanks to my researches I've taught myself how to teleport. Using this new skill I can teleport you for free wherever you want to.<br>
Choose the place you want to travel. If you are going to teleport in the Dragon Valley, I'll give you a request.<br>
