<html><body>Underground Labyrinth Guide:<br>
Welcome! I am your guide through the Underground Labyrinth. I used to work in Aden but was assigned here some time ago. I take pleasure in seeing chaotic players struggle in this labyrinth.
If you wish to be set free, bring me <font color="LEVEL">100 Marks of Repentance</font> or wait out your sentence, which depends on your PK kills.
