I cannot move you to the Altar of Tyrol! The demon Tyrol will try to subjugate anyone he can, controlling their actions. The number of participants <font color="LEVEL">in the Tyrol mirror ritual</font> is determined by the number of Tyrol Revelations. Don't miss them - remember to look around! To avoid being caught off guard by Tyrol's warriors, remember: <font color="LEVEL">1 Tyrol Revelation marks 10 people.</font> Be vigilant!<br>
