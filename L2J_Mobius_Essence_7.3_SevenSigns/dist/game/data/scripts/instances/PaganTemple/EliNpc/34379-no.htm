With the support of the Elmore Kingdom's aristocracy, a temple was built to worship Tyro. Many workers were sacrificed to this demon of pride, but even in death they found no peace - they were turned into either Tyro's servants or monsters. Contact me if you need more information about this cursed place.<br>
