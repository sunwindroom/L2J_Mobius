I cannot move you to the Altar of Tyrol! Currently, the Altar is peaceful and Tyrol's followers have not yet shown themselves. Remember that **Friday** is the day of worship for Tyrol, when his minions gather in the Chapel. **At the start of the ceremony, at 22:00**, Andreas van Holter and her Guardians appear in the Waiting Room and the Altar Chapel.<br>
