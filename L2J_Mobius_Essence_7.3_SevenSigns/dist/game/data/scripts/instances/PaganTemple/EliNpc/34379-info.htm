<html><body>Supreme Seer Eli:<br>
The Elmore Kingdom's aristocracy was obsessed with eternal life, and so they secretly built a Pagan Temple to secretly worship and offer sacrifices to Tyro, the demon of pride.<br>
It is said that <font color="LEVEL">Friday</font> is the day of Tyro's worship, when his followers gather in the Chapel. <font color="LEVEL">At 10:00 PM, at the start of the ritual</font>, Andreas van Holter and her Guardians appear in the Waiting Hall and the Altar Chapel.<br>
Not everyone can witness <font color="LEVEL">Andreas van Holter</font> in person. Access to the Altar is granted <font color="LEVEL">only to a limited number of participants from two team channels</font>, who manage to destroy Andreas' Guardians.<br>
Remember, Andreas van Holter uses the Subjugation technique, expressing her respect to Tyro in this way!<br>
